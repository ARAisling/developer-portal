Delivering updates to your online audience can be a rewarding, but tedious, task for tournament organizers.
Lunar Phase, a tournament-organizing and broadcast team based out of New York City, have automated some
 of the work involved in the post-event tweets for their events, like

I spoke to <a href="https://twitter.com/gramofdata" target="_blank">Datagram</a>,
 who authored this automated process, to learn more.

## Tell me a quick bit about yourself

*My name's Adrian Mullings, aka Datagram, and I'm co-founder and technical director for
 <a href="https://twitter.com/LunarPhaseProd" target="_blank">Lunar Phase</a>.
We're a NYC-based team that hosts several tournaments a month for a wide variety of fighting games, with our
 primary game being Under Night In-Birth.*

## So what were you doing before you automated these kinds of tweets?

*Back when our events were smaller and we didn't run as many games it was easy and fun to make tournament
 result tweets, but as everything except our team size got bigger we found ourselves not having enough time
 to dedicate to it.
I figured if we were going to keep making result tweets, we needed to find a way to automate it.*
