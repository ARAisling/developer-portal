## How do I contribute documentation?
Great question!

1. Fork/checkout this repo.
2. Add your .md file in the correct place in the `/docs` directory
3. Add the path to your doc file in website/sidebars.json
4. Open a pull request with these changes and wait for approval :)

## Super Quick Tips re: Docs

Here are some quick tips for your docs!

1. Make sure to use H2's as these are used for page nav. Especially for Request and Response in your examples
2. If you are linking to an external page (ie not on developer.smash.gg/*) please have these open in a new tab using `<a href="https://external-site.example" target="_blank">Hyperlink text</a>`
3. If you are linking to a page within developer.smash.gg, please link it as `[hyperlink text](/page)` instead of `[hyperlink text](https://developer.smash.gg/page)`
