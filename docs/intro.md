Our new public API is a GraphQL API, and we're excited for you to use it with your applications.

In addition to our developer portal, also have a <a href="https://discord.gg/smashgg" target="_blank">Discord server</a>
where you can get direct help, share ideas, and discuss the API with smash.gg engineers and other community members.
Once you join the Discord server, please go to the `#flairing` channel and write `/roleme 3rd-party-devs`,
 which will grant you access to view and participate in our `#api-alpha` channels.

You can also contact us via email using `devrelations@smash.gg`
