title: Testing your Requests
---

We recommend testing your requests in our [API explorer](/explorer).
For starters&mdash;and for inspiration&mdash;you can view examples written by the community
under the **Example Usage** section of our dev portal.

To test and adapt an example:
1) Copy one of the example requests and its request variables into the API explorer  
(like [Tournaments by Location](examples/tournaments-by-location)), then execute the query:

2) Adjust the query and its variables in the API Explorer and then execute it again
