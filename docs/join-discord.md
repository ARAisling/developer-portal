Our Discord is the best place to discuss our public API, get help from our engineers and community devs,
 find collaborators, and promote your projects using the API!

## How to Join our Community on Discord

1. If you do not already have a Discord account, then [make one](https://discordapp.com/register)!
2. Go to [discord.gg/smashgg](https://discord.gg/smashgg) to join our server
3. Once you have joined our server, go to the #flairing channel, type `/roleme 3rd-party-devs` hit Enter
 (this will give you the 3rd-party-devs role in our server)
4. Now you can read and participate in channels like #api-alpha-discussion, so say hello and introduce yourself.
 We can't wait to meet you!
